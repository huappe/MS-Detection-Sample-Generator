# MS-Detection-Sample-Generator \nAn Open Source Project to Generate Machine Learning Samples for Object Detection in MapleStory\n![alt text](https://github.com/huappe/MS-Detection-Sample-Generator/blob/main/pictures/result.png)\n\n ## Performance \nThe generator can generate as many annotated samples as you need. All bounding boxes are precisely annotated based on rendering coordinates. Using data generated by this tool and ~5000 samples with YOLOv4, achieve up to 99.8% mAP in the test set.\n![alt text](https://github.com/huappe/MS-Detection-Sample-Generator/blob/main/pictures/chart_yolov4-custom.png)\n\n ## Requirements \n* Visual Studio 2022 v17.8 or above, with .NET workload installed \n* .NET 8.0 SDK (8.0.0 or above)\n\n## Build Procedure\n1. Clone this repository with submodules by running `git clone --recursive git@github.com:huappe/MS-Detection-Sample-Generator.git` (`--recursive` is necessary).\n2. First, build `WzComparerR2/WzComparerR2.sln` (the submodule MUST be built after).\n3. Then build `MS-Detection-Sample-Generator.sln`.\n4. Finally, run `MapleStory.MachineLearningSampleGenerator\bin\Release\net8.0-windows7.0\WzComparerR2.exe`. Running `WzComparerR2.exe` will generate `Setting.config`, which is required for our MapRender.\n\n## Execution Procedure\n1. Move into the executable directory using the command `cd MapleStory.MachineLearningSampleGenerator\bin\Release\net8.0-windows7.0`.\n2. Prepare PNGs of your player in a directory - these images should be transparent PNGs with only the player's appearance. You can get these PNGs by Photoshop or save from WzComparerR2's Avatar plugin.\n3. Run the sampler command as explained in the entrypoint [Program.cs](https://github.com/huappe/MS-Detection-Sample-Generator/blob/main/MapleStory.MachineLearningSampleGenerator/Program.cs)\n\n ## Note \nIf you want to hide all NPCs from the generated samples (since NPCs look like players and can affect your model negatively), modi
